## 3. Memory Architecture Comparison  

| **Feature**            | **AMD Ryzen 3**              | **Intel Core i7**            | **Superior** | **Reason** |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Memory Type**       | DDR5                     | DDR5, DDR4                | ‚Äì           | Both offer high speed, great bandwidth and low power consumption. |
| **Max Memory Speed**  | DDR5 ‚Äì 5200 MT/s          | DDR5 ‚Äì 5600 MT/s <br> DDR4 ‚Äì 3200 MT/s | Intel i7 | Intel officially supports higher DDR5 speeds and gives the option to use DDR4. |
| **Channels**          | Dual Channel              | Dual Channel              | ‚Äì           | Dual channel memory increases bandwidth and improves responsiveness. |
| **Cache Hierarchy**   | L1: 64 KB/core <br> L2: 1 MB/core <br> L3: 8 MB shared | L1: 80 KB/core <br> L2: 2 MB/core (P-core), 4 MB/module (E-core) <br> L3: 33 MB shared | Intel i7 | Larger L2 and L3 caches reduce latency and improve performance. |
| **Memory Capacity**   | Up to 64 GB or 128 GB     | Up to 64 GB or 128 GB     | ‚Äì           | Both support similar maximum memory configurations (depends on motherboard). |  

**Conclusion:**  
- **AMD Ryzen 3:** More thermally efficient (7nm process, lower TDP), easier to cool.  
- **Intel i7:** Higher performance, but generates more heat ‚Äî requiring robust cooling solutions. Its hybrid architecture boosts efficiency in light workloads.  

---

## 4. Thermal Management  

- **Intel i7:** Offers top-tier performance but produces more heat, making effective cooling essential.  
- **AMD Ryzen 3:** Runs cooler and is more power-efficient, making it an excellent choice for compact or low-noise builds.  

---

## 5. Final Thoughts  
The **superior choice depends largely on the target workload**:  

- **Intel i7:** Ideal for professional applications needing strong single-threaded performance (e.g., CAD, simulation, and gaming with high FPS requirements).  
- **AMD Ryzen 3:** Better suited for users prioritizing power efficiency, lower heat output, and good integrated graphics capabilities.
